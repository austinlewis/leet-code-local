    General

    * Are the metrics of runtime & memory important? If so, Why? and, Are they reliable data in Leetcode? also, Are they different from person-to-person or submission-to-submission?
        - 217. Submission_2 & Submission_3 were slightly modified between each other which had best time-complexity to test reliablity of a submission detail.
    * What actually causes time-limit exceeded issue? and How is the condition tested? also, How to identify or have a forethought on solution that could lead to this scenario?
        - using .count() - time complexity is O(n)
        - using __contains__ or in - time complexity is O(n)
    * Does enumeration in for-loop make any difference?
        - 73. Submission_2 uses enumeration no difference in leet-code submission details
    * specific to python3
        - reduce usage of .sort() - time complexity O(n.logn)
        - eracdicating duplicates by creating a set - space complexity o(n) and is a good approach when space-complexity is not restricted to constant or O(1)

    268. Missing Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/
    
    - Submission_1
        * Above method loops through all values time-complexity is more
        * __contains__ is an overloader method for any userdefined class, should not be used randomnly
        * A better approach was to calculate sum of given list and then calculate actual sum using n*(n+1)/2

    - Submission_n
        * Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

    448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
    https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/

    - Submission_1
        * __contains__ is an overloader method for any userdefined class, should not be used randomnly

    136. Single Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

    - Submission_1
        * Above method loops through all methods time-complexity is more

    - Submission_2
        * Replacing extra count-condition with try-except for remove cut execution-time by half in leetcode
        * A better approach was to use Bitwise-XOR, i.e., result ^= nums[i] : twice appearning digits cancel out each other while leaving the one time appearing digit in result

    238. Product of Array Except Self
    https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

    - Submission_1:
        * Time limit exceeded

    - Submission_3:
        * Slight change from Submission_2 method looping method and use of list-compression

    - Submission_n
        * Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

    287. Find the Duplicate Number
    https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/

    - Submission_1
        * Time limit exceeded

    - Submission_n
        Follow up:
        * How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
        * Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

    73. Set Matrix Zeroes
    https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

    - Submission_2:
        * Using enumeration in fopr-loop

    - Submission_n
        Follow up:
        * A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
        * A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
        * Could you devise a constant space solution?

    48. Rotate Image
    https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

    - Submission_1:
        * A better approach coul have been, Reverse on Diagonal and then Reverse Left to Right:
            Even though this approach does twice as many reads and writes, 
            most people would consider it a better approach because the code is simpler, 
            and it is built with standard matrix operations that can be found in any matrix library.
